# code-of-conduct

[Read the Code of Conduct](https://github.com/softwareunderground/code-of-conduct/blob/master/v2019.02.md)

Adopting a Code of Conduct on the Software Underground was discussed [on the Slack group](https://swung.slack.com/archives/C094GV18T/p1541239372016700) in early November 2018. 

A first version was adopted in January 2019 and posted on [softwareunderground.org](https://softwareunderground.org). 

It was adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 1.4, available at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.html.
