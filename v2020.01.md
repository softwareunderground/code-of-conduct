# Code of Conduct v 2020.01

## OUR PLEDGE

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as community members pledge to making participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

This Code of Conduct applies to all of the community’s activities, including the Slack chat environment, its code repositories, online meetings, and its face-to-face events and meetups.

## OUR STANDARDS

Examples of behaviour that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language.
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.
- Focusing on what is best for the community.
- Showing empathy towards other community members.
- When you see an unacceptable act, challenge the behaviour but not the person.

Examples of unacceptable behaviour by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
- Racist or racially biased remarks, attacks, or content.
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission.
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## OUR RESPONSIBILITIES

The board is responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behaviour.

The board has the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, code, edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviours that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## SCOPE

This Code of Conduct applies to everyone in the community, including the board, our members, and non-member participants in any of the Software Underground's activities.

It applies both within community spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of the community may be further defined and clarified by community maintainers.

## ENFORCEMENT

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour may be reported by contacting the board at hello@softwareunderground.org. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The community maintainers are obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Community members who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the community.
